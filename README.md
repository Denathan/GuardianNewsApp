## **6# Google Nanodegree Program Project: News App**

**Topic:** Networking

**Project Description:** This project is stage 1 of a 2 stage project. For this stage, create an app to display recent news stories on a topic of your choice using an API. In this second and final stage, you'll add a preference screen to the News App you've already created.

**What I've learned:**
-   Connecting to an API
-   Parsing the JSON response
-   Handling error cases gracefully
-   Updating information regularly
-   Using an AsyncTask
-   Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
-   Implement the Preference Fragment
-   Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
-   Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
-   Update and display the Preference Summary
